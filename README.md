# Alexa Skill Project Template for Visual Studio
A Visual Studio project template that allows to create Alexa Skills using an Azure Function as backend, without the need of writing the boilerplate code requested by Amazon and some best practices.

You can install the template from the [Visual Studio Market Place](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MarcoMinerva.AlexaSkillProjectTemplate).

A big thank to [Matteo Pagani](https://twitter.com/qmatteoq) for the [initial code](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-AppConsult-samples-PWA/tree/master/AlexaSkill) of the template and for his great and continuous support, and to [Emanuele Bartolesi](http://www.emanuelebartolesi.com) for helping us creating the VSIX installer.
